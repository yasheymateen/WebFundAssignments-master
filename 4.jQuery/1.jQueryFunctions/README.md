## For this assignment, you need to showcase how to use each of the listed jQuery functions.  We've built an index.html file, functions.js, and style.css file for you and will show you how to do the .addClass() function. Follow a similar pattern for the remaining functions.  Don't forget to use the Chrome Dev Tools to see how your HTML is being manipulated by jQuery as you test out these functions.
