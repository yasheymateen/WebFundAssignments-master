## For this assignment, we've taken the liberty of getting all the files you need without having to run a git clone command.  If you want to try the git clone instructions, YOU'LL NEED TO DO YOUR git clone -b error_version https://github.com/Codingdojo-Trey/Debugging-jQuery.git COMMAND IN A DIRECTORY THAT IS NOT INSIDE WebFundamentals.  A good place would be the Desktop or Documents directories on your laptops. We warn you about this because you don't want a repo inside a repo.
