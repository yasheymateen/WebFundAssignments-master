## With this assignment, we've created an algorithm3part1.txt file and an algorithm3.js file for you already. You can test the Javascript code from the platform and run your code at JSBin.com.  Don't forget to do Part 1 of the assignment on pen/paper and put it in the .txt file while you are getting used to doing T-Diagrams.  The algorithm3.js file is for Part 2. Go to that file for more instructions.
